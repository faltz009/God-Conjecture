Corresponded with Lee Cronin (Assembly Theory) over email.

His comment:

Sam,

The universe cannot be a computer because computation is not invariant. This is the major flaw with this work and any computational paradigm of the universe.

Lee

My response via email to address this point:

Lee,

I wanted to address this in more detail because I’m not taking the Wolfram position (Hard Computational Realism).

The ontology of the paper is as follows:

Causal / Morphological structure is invariant (the graph structure of Ruliad, or Assembly space in your work)
Computational parsing by Observers is not invariant (agree with your view)
But Categorical relationships are invariant (entropy inequalities, functor composition for all possible observers, natural transformations in the graph-based structure, and conservation laws)
To address the invariance point in depth:

the sampling functor explicitly models this observer-dependence (in fact this is literally what the papers about!)
However, this doesn't mean there are NO invariants
The invariants in this model exist at the categorical level
Invariants

Morphological invariants: The causal structure (which events causally influence which others) is observer-independent (see below directly relevant to your work!)o 2. Entropic invariants: H(Observable Ruliad) ≤ H(Whole Ruliad) holds for ALL observer functors (proven in paper, related to data processing inequality)
Compositional invariants: Functor composition is associative for all observers (i.e. every observer runs the SAME computational process even if the results differ)
Conservation laws: Noether charges (energy, momentum) are invariant across all observer parsing's (giving you physics invariants)
In fact, Assembly Theory adds another invariant to the structure in my paper – the selection history. While, samplings (computational) vary across Observers, the minimal assembly sequence is Observer-independent in the God Conjecture.

Proof sketch from category theory:

Let S₁, S₂ be two observer functors sampling the full possibility space (here the full Ruliad)
The causal partial order ≺ on that space (event x causally precedes event y) is preserved:

If x ≺R y, then either:

S₁(x) ≺RO₁ S₁(y), or
S₁(x) = S₁(y) (coarse-grained together)
Proof:
Functors preserve morphisms (by definition)
Causal order is defined by morphism existence (there exists a path x → y)
Therefore, causal order cannot be inverted by sampling, only potentially coarse-grained.
This guarantees different Observers cannot disagree on causal structure (only on the computational interpretation).
